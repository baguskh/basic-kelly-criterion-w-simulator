kelly-criterion-w-simulator app
kelly criterion simulator - VS C#


Built on VisualStudio 2013, C#

+ Created to calculate the kelly criterion based on binomial distribution and several assumptions, then simulate it.
+ The main output:
  - value of the kelly fraction
  - number of players which win the maximum pot
  - the average player's cash after playing this game
  - data record of the simulation.
+ 90.000 records on the worst case (for 300 players and games)

This app assumed that players can bet on every fraction of cash when playing, so the amount of player's cash cannot converge to zero or less)
